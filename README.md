#### About

Whoya (pronounced "Who-Ya?") is a simple Android app that shows incoming and outgoing calls received from your android device.


#### Architecture

Whoya follows many of the core Android "architecture components" offered, first at Google I/O in the summer of 2018. These include:

- LiveData functional updates.
- Coroutines for asyncronous tasks.
- Material-Design conventions.
- Fully Kotlin codebase.


#### TODO:
- **Feature:** CNAM 'dips' for converting unknown phone numbers into **whoya** names.
- **Feature:** Floating android view to show CNAM **whoya** names on incoming calls.
- **Feature:** Allow any number to be entered to show the actual **whoya** name.
- Convert basic coroutines into scoped ViewModel coroutines.
- Improve number formatting and move to a testable utility.
- Add JUnit tests for core business functionality (such as number formatting).

- More stuff that I probably have forgotten :-)
